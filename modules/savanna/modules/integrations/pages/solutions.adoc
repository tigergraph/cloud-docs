= Solutions
:experimental:

TigerGraph Savanna offers pre-built solution kits that address common use cases and industry-specific challenges.
These solutions provide a starting point for your graph database projects, offering pre-configured schemas, sample data, and query templates.

[TIP]
====
By leveraging solutions, you can accelerate development, reduce time-to-insights, and focus on extracting value from your graph data.
====

[NOTE]
====
We limit the number of solutions that can be installed in a workspace to one to ensure that the workspace is not overloaded with unnecessary data and queries.
====

Explore the available solutions and experiment with them in your own specific use cases.

== Prerequisites
To start creating your first solution you will need to have a xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/readwrite-readonly.adoc#_read_write_rw_workspace[Read-Write Workspace]  already created.

[TIP]
====
This option is useful if you want to quickly evaluate the solution kit or understand its functionality without the need to load your own data.
====

* *Load Your Own Data*: With this option, you have the flexibility to load your own data into the solution kit.
You can import your data from various sources, such as CSV files, databases, or other data formats supported by TigerGraph.

* *No Data*: If you choose the btn:[No Data] option, the solution kit will be set up without any pre-loaded or user-provided data.
It provides you with pre-defined graph schema and queries, where you can load your own data afterward using GSQL Editor or Data Ingestion.

[TIP]
====
This option is useful if you want to start with a clean slate and build your blank solution from scratch.
