= Workspace Overview

A *Workspace* is a compute unit within a TigerGraph database.
It is where the graph processing and analytics take place.
TigerGraph Cloud 4 supports two types of workspaces: read-write workspaces and read-only workspaces.

** *Read-Write Workspaces (RW)*: These workspaces allow read and write operations on the graph data.
They are typically used for data ingestion, data updates, and running queries that modify the graph structure or properties.

** *Read-Only Workspaces (RO)*: These workspaces are optimized for read-intensive operations.
They are used for executing queries and analytics on the graph data without modifying it.
Read-only workspaces provide improved performance and scalability for read operations.

[TIP]
====
The separation of compute and storage in workspaces allows for optimized performance and resource allocation, while the databases ensure the persistence and accessibility of the graph data.
====

* The *database* in TigerGraph Cloud 4 refers to the actual data stored within the platform.
It is separate from the workspaces and can be associated with one or more workspaces within a workgroup.
It holds the persistent data that is loaded into TigerGraph and is accessible for graph analytics and visualization.

[NOTE]
====
We only support a maximum of one Read-Write workspace to connect to a database.
