= Workspace Overview

A *Workspace* is a compute unit within a TigerGraph database.
It is where the graph processing and analytics take place.
TigerGraph Savanna supports two types of workspaces: read-write workspaces and read-only workspaces.

** *Read-Write Workspaces (RW)*: These workspaces allow read and write operations on the graph data.
They are typically used for data ingestion, data updates, and running queries that modify the graph structure or properties.

** *Read-Only Workspaces (RO)*: These workspaces are optimized for read-intensive operations.
They are used for executing queries and analytics on the graph data without modifying it.
Read-only workspaces provide improved performance and scalability for read operations.

[TIP]
====
The separation of compute and storage in workspaces allows for optimized performance and resource allocation, while the databases ensure the persistence and accessibility of the graph data.
====

* The *database* in TigerGraph Savanna refers to the actual data stored within the platform.
It is separate from the workspaces and can be associated with one or more workspaces within a workgroup.
It holds the persistent data that is loaded into TigerGraph and is accessible for graph analytics and visualization.

[NOTE]
====
We only support a maximum of one Read-Write workspace to connect to a database.

=== Operations Restricted in a Read-Only (RO) Workspace

In a Read-Only (RO) workspace within TigerGraph Savanna, the following operations are restricted:

.Database Operations
- Running "gsql --reset" command.
- Clearing the graph store.
- Executing the DROP ALL command.

.Schema Management
- Updating schemas, including adding, updating, or dropping schema elements.
- Creating, dropping, or running schema change jobs.

.Graph Management
- Creating or dropping graphs.
- Exporting or importing database data.

.Data Modification
- Running any queries that modify the database data.
- Inserting, updating, or deleting data.
- Committing the data(such as new vertices or edges) in memory to disk. for example: rebuildnow operation

.Loading Jobs
- Creating, deleting, or running loading jobs.
- Creating, deleting, pausing, restarting, or resuming connectors.
- Creating or updating data sources.

.Backup and Restore
- Performing backup or restore operations.
