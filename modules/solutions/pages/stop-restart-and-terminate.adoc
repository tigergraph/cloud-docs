This list can be found under Solutions on the left side menu or on the main page. If you know that your organization account has running solutions but you are unable to see them, check to see that your account has the correct xref:security:managa-org-users.adoc[user access privileges].

== Stop a solution

When you stop a solution, you shut down the virtual machine instance.
The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state.
Billing for that machine instance also stops.
Scheduled backups also stop, but the backup copies are kept in EFS on AWS, Azure Files on Azure, and GCP Filestore on GCP.

You will still incur charges for disk storage and backups when a solution is stopped.

== Restart a solution

You can restart a stopped solution at any time. After a warm-up period, the solution will return to the state it was in when it was stopped.

== Terminate a solution

By terminating a solution, you deprovision the virtual machine and the attached disk storage. The solution, as well as everything in the attached disk storage, is deleted according to the cloud platform's policies and cannot be recovered.


=== Archive a solution

After a solution has been terminated, it can be archived so that it no longer shows up on the default view in the list of solutions.

To archive a solution, click on the solution row in My Solutions to expand it and click the *Archived* toggle.
