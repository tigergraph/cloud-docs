TigerGraph Cloud allows an Organization Admin to
xref:cloud:security:manage-org-users.adoc#_invite_new_users_to_an_organization[manage multiple users in your organization] and control their access to various clusters.

This page explains the user access controls. For help with setting up clusters, visit xref:solutions:create-a-solution.adoc[].

== Invite new users to an organization
The account that creates an organization is automatically given the role of an Organization Admin.
The first time you log in to a new organization account, you have the opportunity to add additional users to your organization with different roles and privileges.

You can also add users later by clicking the sidebar button btn:[Users].
This takes you to the Access Management Page.
From there, click the btn:[Invite Users] button in the upper right corner.

Invitations will expire after seven days. If an invitation expires, resend the invitation.

=== Manage existing users in an organization

In the Access Management section on the Users page, you can check the invitation status of each user who has been sent an invitation and also invite new users.

Click on the three-dot menu btn:[•••] to modify a user's role or delete the account. Deleting the account removes the user from all clusters in the organization.

Click btn:[Invite Users] in the upper-right corner of the page to send out more email invitations to new users and place them in various roles.

[NOTE]
User management was redesigned with the release of TigerGraph v3.6.0 in July 2022. Clusters created before then are only visible to Organization Admins and Cluster Admins.
These legacy clusters exist entirely outside of the User Management system and can still be accessed by ordinary users with the URL.

=== TigerGraph cluster roles

A user in an organization on TigerGraph Cloud is separate from a user on a TigerGraph cluster.
On TigerGraph Cloud, a single user in an organization may be assigned to several clusters and have various roles on those clusters.

In this documentation, for consistency, we will refer to these using the terms "organization role" and "cluster role."

For information about the TigerGraph cluster roles, see the page xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:access-control-model.adoc[].

When a TigerGraph Cloud user is added to a cluster as an Organization Cluster Admin or Organization Admin, they are granted the `superuser` role on that cluster.
A user added to a cluster as an Organization Member has no role on the cluster by default, but can be assigned a cluster role by anyone with the `superuser` cluster role.



//=== Teams

//You can group your users into a team by clicking btn:[Create Team] in the upper-right corner. Teams are helpful for granting and revoking access to certain clusters for large numbers of users.

=== Cluster Management

On the *My Clusters* page, click the third button in the Actions row for each cluster to enter the *Cluster Access Management* page.
From there, you can grant or revoke access to the cluster for different users.
