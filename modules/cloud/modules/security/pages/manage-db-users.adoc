= Manage Database Users
:experimental:
:page-aliases: manage-database-users.adoc

When you connect to a TigerGraph Cloud Classic instance programmatically, such as from connectors like pyTigerGraph or the remote GSQL client, you often need to provide credentials that are created in the database of your cluster.
This is different from your TigerGraph Organization account which allows you to log in to clusters in your organization to which you have access.

NOTE: You can only create database users for clusters created after August 18th, 2022.
