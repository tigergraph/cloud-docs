= Authentication

To use the TigerGraph Savanna REST APIs, you need to authenticate your requests. Authentication is typically done using API keys.

[IMPORTANT]

== Setup API Keys

Before you can authenticate your API requests, you need to set up your API keys. Please refer to the xref:savanna:administration:settings/how2-create-api-key.adoc[API Key Setup] page for detailed instructions on how to generate and manage your API keys.

== Example Request

Hereâ€™s an example of how to consume the APIs using your API key:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.tgcloud.io/users" \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>"
```
