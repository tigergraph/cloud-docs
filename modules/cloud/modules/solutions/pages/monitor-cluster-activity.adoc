TigerGraph Cloud Classic allows users to monitor activity at the organization and cluster level.

== Organization Activity Log

Click btn:[Activities] on the left-side menu in TigerGraph Cloud Classic to see a log of all actions performed on all clusters in the organization.

=== Filter activities by date or keyword

Select a date range at the top to limit results to a certain time.

You can also search by keyword across all three columns.
In the example screenshot shown previously, the search was filtered by the term "controller" to only show actions performed by the system controller.

== Cluster Activity Log

Each cluster also has an activity log, where you can view actions specific to that cluster.

First find a cluster in the cluster list that you want to monitor and click the Access Management button.
