== (updated Jan 20, 2025)

These TigerGraph Savanna Subscription Terms (“Subscription Terms”) are part of a legal agreement (the “Agreement”) between the person or entity agreeing to these terms (“Customer”) and TigerGraph, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and includes these Subscription Terms, any terms expressly incorporated herein by reference, and any terms in a fully executed ordering document that incorporates these Subscription Terms (an “Order Schedule”). This Agreement is effective as of the date the Order Schedule is fully executed (the “Effective Date”).

== 1. Subscription
1.1. Subscription Services. Subject to the provisions of these Subscription Terms, TigerGraph will provide certain cloud-based Software services (“Cloud Services”) as specified on an Order Schedule for the period specified in the applicable Order Schedule (the “Subscription Period”).  The Cloud Services will be provided in accordance with the: (i) Order Schedule (ii) Documentation, (iii) SLA, and (iv) Support Policy.

1.2 Definitions. 
“Software” means the TigerGraph Enterprise database software and related tools.
“Console” means the web-based user interface that Customer shall use to access the Cloud Services.
“Customer Data” means all proprietary, non-public electronic data or information submitted to the Cloud Services by Customer.  
“Documentation” means the materials available at docs.tigergraph.com, as amended from time to time.
“SLA” means the TigerGraph Savanna SLA available at www.tigergraph.com/terms,  as amended from time to time.
“Support Policy” means the terms set forth in the TigerGraph Support Policy available at www.tigergraph.com/terms as amended from time to time.

1.3  Modifications; Discontinuation of Service.  TigerGraph may make modifications to the Cloud Services or components of the Cloud Services, including the Software, from time to time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer of any material modifications.  TigerGraph reserves the right to discontinue offering the Cloud Services at the conclusion of Customer’s then-current Subscription Period.

1.4 TigerGraph Savanna Free Tier Users and Free Credit.  TigerGraph may allow Customer to use the Cloud Services on a no-fee basis, including through the provision of free credit that can be used on Cloud Services. If such no-fee use or free credit is allowed, TigerGraph shall not be subject to the SLA, Support Policy, and the warranties set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2. Customer’s free use of the TigerGraph Savanna Services may be terminated at any time at TigerGraph’s discretion. 

== 2. Payment
2.1. Fees. Customer will pay all fees specified in the Order Schedule for Cloud Services (“Fees”). If the Order Schedule specifies a subscription basis, all Fees are due 30 days from the invoice date. If the Order Schedule specifies a pay-as-you-go basis, Customer shall provide a credit card for the payment of Fees. For the pay-as-you-go basis, Customer authorizes a recurring monthly charge to your credit card based on our current fee schedule for the Cloud Services. All Fees are non-refundable and non-cancelable. Unless otherwise specified in the Order Schedule, all Fees are in U.S. dollars and shall be paid without setoff or deduction.  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Schedule, upon renewal of the Subscription Period, the Fees will be the then-current list price for Cloud Services.

2.2. Taxes. Customer is responsible for any duties, customs fees, or taxes (other than TigerGraph’s income tax) associated with the Cloud Services and professional services, including any related penalties or interest (“Taxes”), and shall pay the listed Fees without deduction for Taxes. If Customer is required by applicable law to withhold any amount from any payments specified in the Order Schedule, then Customer will pay TigerGraph the listed Fees as if no withholding were required, and shall remit the withholding to the appropriate governmental authorities on behalf of TigerGraph, with a copy of the tax receipt or certificate forwarded to TigerGraph.

2.3. Delinquencies. Any late payments will accrue late charges at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.  

2.4 Bursting.  Customer agrees that the Cloud Services may enable Customer to exceed the use limits defined in the Service Order, provided that if such use is repeated or excessive, as determined by TigerGraph, TigerGraph may invoice Customer, and Customer will pay for, the number of required additional use, prorated over the remaining Subscription Period.  In no event shall Customer’s no-charge bursting use exceed 50 percent of the use amount for the Subscription Period, and any no-charge bursting shall be limited to thirty (30) total days within the Subscription Period. If Customer declines to increase the use limits as recommended by TigerGraph or otherwise refuses to cooperate with TigerGraph to increase its licensed use, TigerGraph may suspend Customer’s use of the Cloud Services, until such time as Customer is able to reduce its use to the licensed levels.

== 3. Restrictions
All rights in the Software, Console, and Cloud Services not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved to TigerGraph or its licensors. Without limiting the foregoing (except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law), Customer shall not, and shall not permit others under its control to: (1) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software, Console, or any component of the Cloud Services; (2) assign, sublicense, transfer, lease, rent or otherwise distribute or make available the Software or Console, or Cloud Services to any third party; (3) use the Cloud Services for High Risk Activities or otherwise contrary to the Documentation; (4) use the Cloud Services to create, deliver training on, improve (directly or indirectly) or offer a substantially similar product or service; (5) reconfigure the Cloud Services without prior written consent from TigerGraph; (6) use the included ODBC driver to connect to other distributions of the components of the Software, or (7) perform benchmarking of the Cloud Services.  “High Risk Activities” means uses such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems, where the use or failure of the Software could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage. The Software includes the third party software and material specified at https://docs.tigergraph.com (“Third Party Software”).

== 4. Proprietary Rights; Data
4.1. License. The Cloud services do not include the separate licensing or any sale of Software. Subject to the provisions of these Subscription Terms and Order Schedule, TigerGraph grants Customer a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, terminable license to access the Software provided with the Cloud Services during the Subscription Period, subject to any license parameters specified in the applicable Order Schedule.  As between the parties, all intellectual property rights in the Software and Cloud Services shall remain with TigerGraph or its licensors. Software and Cloud Services may be updated at any time. If TigerGraph materially reduces the Cloud Services, if practicable, TigerGraph will provide reasonable notice of no less than six months prior notice to Customer.

4.6. Access for Support. Customer agrees to allow TigerGraph to access their environment for the purpose of providing support and maintenance services. This access will be conducted in accordance with TigerGraph's Support Policy and will be limited to the actions necessary to resolve support issues or perform maintenance tasks. TigerGraph will ensure that such access is conducted securely and in compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.

4.7. GDPR.  Should Customer Data contain personal data as defined by The EU general data protection regulation 2016/679 “GDPR,” this Agreement shall be a contract as specified by Article 28(3) of the GDPR. Customer agrees that it shall comply with its obligations as a controller under the GDPR. In its role as a processor under the GDPR, TigerGraph agrees that it:
(a) processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;

 (f) assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor;
(g) at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data;

== 8. Indemnity
8.1. Indemnity by TigerGraph. TigerGraph shall defend or settle at its sole expense any claim brought against Customer, its directors, officers, or employees by a third party alleging that the Software as installed by TigerGraph in the Cloud Services infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, or trade secret of a third party, and TigerGraph shall pay all damages finally awarded or costs of settlement of the claim provided that Customer: (1) provides TigerGraph prompt written notice of any claim; (2) gives TigerGraph sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim but may not settle any claim unless such settlement fully releases Customer from any liability; and (3) provides all reasonable assistance in connection with the claim.

8.2. Injunctions. If Customer’s rights to use the Software are, or in TigerGraph’ opinion could be, enjoined due to an indemnified claim, then TigerGraph may, at its sole option and expense: (1) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Software according to the terms of this Agreement, (2) modify the Software such that it operates with materially equivalent functionality without infringing or misappropriation, or (3) if neither of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, terminate the Agreement and refund any prepaid portion of the Fees attributable to the period following termination.

In entering into this Agreement, neither party has relied on, and neither party will have any right or remedy based on, any statement, representation or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently), except those expressly set out in this Agreement. The terms located at a URL referenced in this Agreement are hereby incorporated by this reference. After the Effective Date, TigerGraph may provide Customer with an updated URL in place of any URL in this Agreement.

11.11. Severability and Waiver. In the event that any provision of this Agreement (or any portion hereof) is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the provision (or portion) will be enforced to the extent possible consistent with the stated intention of the parties, or, if incapable of enforcement, will be deemed to be severed and deleted from this Agreement, while the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force.  The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.

11.13. Survival. The following sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement:  Payment, Restrictions, Proprietary Rights, Effect of Termination, Confidentiality, Limitation of Liability, and Miscellaneous.

11.14. Updates. Except as expressly provided herein, no modification of this Agreement will be effective unless contained in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party. TigerGraph may make changes to terms located at a URL referenced in this Agreement, including these Subscription Terms (collectively, the “URL Terms”) from time to time.  TigerGraph will post the amended terms and will update the “Last Updated Date” at the top. By continuing to use the Cloud Services, Console, or Software after TigerGraph has provided Customer with such notice of a change, Customer is indicating that it agrees to be bound by the modified terms. If the change has a material adverse impact on Customer and Customer does not agree to the change, Customer must notify TigerGraph within 30 days of the applicable Last Updated Date. If Customer notifies TigerGraph as required, then Customer will remain governed by the terms in effect immediately prior to the change until the end of the then-current Subscription Period. If the Subscription Period is renewed, it will do so under the updated URL Terms.
