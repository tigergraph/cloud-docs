This is a guide for setting up a VPC peering connection between your
TigerGraph Cloud Classic VPC and another AWS VPC.

== Prerequisites

* Unterminated TigerGraph Cloud Classic clusters on AWS

[[initiate-vpc-peering]]

In the Peer VPC section, fill in the information of the VPC that you
want to peer with:

* *AWS Account ID*
** The ID of the VPC ownerâ€™s AWS account.
* *Region*
** The region of the VPC you want to peer with.
* *VPC ID*
** The ID of the VPC from the AWS dashboard.
* *CIDR*
** CIDR-block of the peered VPC. You can also use an
IPv6 CIDR here if your peered VPC has one.

Click btn:[Initiate VPC Peering].

[[accept-vpc-peering-request]]
=== Accept VPC peering request

TigerGraph then sends a VPC peering connection to your VPC. Follow the steps below to accept the peering
connection on your AWS VPC. See more in AWS's documentation on
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/create-vpc-peering-connection.html#accept-vpc-peering-connection[Accepting
VPC Peering Connections].

[arabic]
. Go to menu:VPC service[Peering Connections] in the AWS web console
. Accept the connection from the TigerGraph VPC

[[update-route-table-for-vpc-peering-connection]]
=== Update route table for VPC peering connection

After accepting the peering request, you still need to update your route
table for the peering connection.

To add a route for a VPC peering connection:

[arabic]
. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
. In the navigation pane, choose btn:[Route Tables].
. Select the checkbox next to the route table that's associated with
the subnet in which your instance resides.
. Choose menu:Actions[Edit routes].
. Choose btn:[Add route].
. For *Destination*, enter the CIDR block of the TigerGraph VPC you are
peering with. You can find the CIDR block of the TigerGraph VPC at
btn:[Peering Connections] in the VPC service where you accepted the peering
connection. There is a column "*Requester CIDRs*"*.*
. For *Target*, select the VPC peering connection, and then choose *Save
changes*.
