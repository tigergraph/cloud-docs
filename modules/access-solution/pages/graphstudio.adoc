= Access a Solution through GraphStudio

The TigerGraph GraphStudio™ UI (User Interface) provides an intuitive, browser-based interface that helps users get started quickly with graph-based application development tasks: designing a graph schema, creating a schema mapping, loading data, exploring the graph, and writing GSQL queries. GraphStudio is supported in the same way on TigerGraph Cloud as the on-premise version of TigerGraph.
