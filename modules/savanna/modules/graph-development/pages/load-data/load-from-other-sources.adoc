= Load from Other Sources

TigerGraph Savanna supports various data sources for ingestion, providing flexibility in integrating with your existing data infrastructure.
GSQL templates can be used for connectors that are not yet supported in the step-by-step loading guide.
See xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:index.adoc[Data Loading in TigerGraph DB] for guides to loading data into TigerGraph.

Additionally, data can also be loaded from a JDBC Connection as well, See xref:savanna:graph-development:load-data/jdbc.adoc[] for more details.
