* *Step-by-Step Guide*: The data loading tool includes a user-friendly interface that guides you through the data loading process step-by-step.
This approach is suitable for users who prefer a visual and interactive experience.

The step-by-step guides helps you:

** Configure the data source.
** Map the data to your graph schema.
** Customize import options.

* *GSQL Template*: Is for users who prefer a more programmatic approach or have complex data loading requirements.
The GSQL template option allows you to define custom data loading logic using GSQL scripts.
So, you have more flexibility and control over the data loading process.

=== Data Loading Tool Limitations

When selecting a data source a step-by-step guide might not always be available.
When this is the case users will see btn:[Open in GSQL Editor] on the bottom right of the panel.
