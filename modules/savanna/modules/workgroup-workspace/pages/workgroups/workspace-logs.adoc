= Workspace Log
:experimental:

The Workspace Log feature provides full-text search capabilities for workspace logs (including historical logs, with a default retrievable period of 30 days) and allows filtering of logs based on time, nodes, and components. This feature enables teams not only to quickly locate and resolve issues but also to gain in-depth insights into system performance, user behavior, and operational auditing, ultimately enhancing system reliability and performance.

[TIP]
====
The Log feature is only available to users on the xref:savanna:resources:quota_policy.adoc#_subscription_plans[Enterprise plan].
If you wish to have access to this feature, please contact support@tigergraph.com to enable it for your organization.
