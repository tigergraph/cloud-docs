= Access Management
:experimental:

As an organization administrator, you can define permissions for users, controlling their level of access to workspaces, workgroup and features. This allows you to ensure data security and enforce access control policies within your organization.
In TigerGraph Cloud 4, access management allows you to configure permissions at both the *Resource* level and the *User* level.

== Resource Level

At the resource level, you can configure permissions that apply to specific workspaces within your TigerGraph Cloud organization.
Resource-level permissions determine what actions a user can perform on a specific resource.

[TIP]
====
These permissions allow you to control access to individual resources based on the needs and responsibilities of different users.
====

You can go to xref:cloud4:workgroup-workspace:workgroups/how2-workgroup-access.adoc[] to manage access at the resource level.

== User Level Permission
At the user level, you can define permissions that apply to individual users or groups of users.
User-level permissions determine what actions a user can perform across your entire TigerGraph Cloud 4 organization.

[TIP]
====
These permissions are typically related to administrative tasks and access to workgroups and workspaces.
