= Create a Solution
:experimental:

TigerGraph Cloud solutions offer a full-scale analytics platform to store and query your graph data.

This page guides you through the process of creating a *free-tier* solution (subject to xref:reference:service-limits.adoc[limits]).

[CAUTION]
====
Free-tier solutions are for training, learning, and small-scale proof of concept use cases. Free-tier solutions do not support backup and restore.

For more advanced testing and learning, consider adding a payment method and using paid-tier solutions to access the backup and restore feature.
====

On the home page, if you have no solutions and have the privileges to create a solution in your organization, you will see an option in the center to create a solution.

==== 3. Select TigerGraph version and starter kit.

Not all TigerGraph versions that are offered on-premises are offered on TigerGraph Cloud.
In the dropdown list, choose the version of TigerGraph you want to run.

TigerGraph Cloud Starter Kits are built with a sample graph data schema, dataset, and queries focused on a specific use case to help you get started quickly.
Most of our starter kits have a link:https://www.tigergraph.com/starterkits/[demo video] that walks you through the schema and the queries built for its use case.
If you wish to proceed with your own schema and data, select btn:[Blank].

==== 5. Select platform, region and endpoint type.

TigerGraph Cloud supports free-tier solutions on all three cloud providers.
Select your preferred cloud provider and the region closest to you for the best performance.
Different providers have different regions available.

See the Reference section for a full list of regions available for each cloud provider: xref:reference:README.adoc[Cloud Provider Reference]

==== 6. Select instance type.

Select TG.Free for the purposes of this guide to a free-tier solution.
More powerful virtual machines require you to use credits in your account or connect a payment method.

==== 7. Select disk size.

Select *50 GB* for your disk size to stay within the free tier.

On the free tier, partition and replication are limited to 1, meaning xref:tigergraph-server:ha:index.adoc[high availability (HA)] is disabled.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click *Next*.

==== 8. Enter a name and a tag for your solution.

On the Solution Settings page, you can customize the name by which the solution appears in the solution list and give it a tag for reference.

You can also customize the solution subdomain. If you leave this section blank, a random subdomain name will be automatically generated.

== Log in to GraphStudio

After you have created your solution, it may take a few minutes for it to be ready. Once you see the status of your solution turn to "Ready", you can proceed to log into GraphStudio.


Go to My Solutions. Find the solution that is ready, click the blue Applications icon, and click btn:[GraphStudio].
