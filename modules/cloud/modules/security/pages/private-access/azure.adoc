:description: Setting up Private Link on Azure
:page-aliases: cloud:private-access/azure.adoc


This page describes the setup process for Azure Private Link, a Microsoft service that securely connects a Virtual Network (VN) to Azure APIs without creating an external IP address.
You need an Azure account to use this feature.

== Azure General Workflow

. Begin creating a paid-tier TigerGraph Cloud Classic cluster in a region that supports private access.

. Select “Private“ for the TigerGraph Endpoint Type.

[start=3]
. Fill in your Azure subscription ID.
Behind the scenes, TigerGraph will provision a PrivateLink Service and provide you with the PrivateLink Service Name.
The subscription ID that you provided will be added to the auto-approval allow list.

. In your Azure account, create an endpoint or private endpoint using the PrivateLink Service Name that TigerGraph provided.

. Confirm on the TGCloud Portal that the endpoint has been created and TigerGraph will automatically approve it.

== Instructions
=== Private endpoint via Azure portal
Verify that a dedicated subnet exists to contain the private endpoint and that network policies are disabled. For more information, see Microsoft's article titled link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy[Disable network policies for private endpoints].

. Navigate to the Azure portal.
. Search for and click on btn:[Private Link].
. Click *Private endpoints* and then click btn:[Add].
. In the Resource section, select *Connect to an Azure resource by resource ID or alias* for Connection Method, and fill in the *Resource ID* or *Alias Field* fields.
The *Request message* value is optional.

. Return to the Private endpoints section and allow a few minutes for processing. On approval, the Private Endpoint displays a *CONNECTION STATE* value of *Approved*.

=== Private endpoint via CLI

Make sure you have the latest Azure CLI tools from this link: link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[How to install the Azure CLI]

Replace the values in angle brackets `<>` with the relevant information for your cluster.

[source.wrap, bash]
----
az network private-endpoint \
create -g resource-group \
-n private-endpoint \
--vnet-name <vnet> \
--subnet <subnet> \
--private-connection-resource-id <d26eb624-5dfe-4188-91e4-075891834eda-private-link-service--a399431deb702616.5c02aae8-aac9-4453-8485-2930a3fee4f1.westus.azure.privatelinkservice> \
--connection-name <private-endpoint-connection> \
--location <westus> \
--manual-request true
----

=== Private DNS
To get the endpoint IP address, navigate to the Private Endpoint.
Locate the Network Interface and copy the value for the Private IP address (i.e. `172.16.1.4`).

. Create a Private DNS Zone named `tgcloud.io`

. Select “Virtual Network Link” on the left, click btn:[Add], and select the VNet that the Private Endpoint resides.

. Add an *A* record named `{clusterdomain}.privatelink`  (example: `test-cluster.privatelink`). The value is the private IP address from step 1.
