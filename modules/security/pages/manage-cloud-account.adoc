= Manage Your TigerGraph Cloud User Account
:experimental:

== Account name

Your user account is displayed in the order [First Name] [Last Name] in the list of users in the organization account.

Changing your display name is not currently supported by TigerGraph Cloud.
To change your name, an Organization Admin needs to remove your account and send a new invitation for you to make a new account.

== Account permissions

Search for your own name under the *Users* tab to see what role you have been given in the organization.
If you believe you have been given the wrong organization role in error, contact an Organization Admin for them to change your role.

See xref:manage-database-users.adoc#_organization_roles_and_privileges[Organization roles and privileges] for detailed information on the privileges available to each organization role.
