= Configure User Defined Functions (UDFs) On TigerGraph Savanna
:experimental:

User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in TigerGraph allow you to incorporate custom logic into your GSQL queries. You can configure GSQL to your UDF definitions from a GitHub repository. This is TigerGraph’s recommended approach for managing UDFs.

== Prerequisites

* Familiarity with GSQL and UDF syntax.
* An active TigerGraph Savanna workspace.

== Steps to Update a UDF

1) Set up the TigerGraph Savanna workspace and ensure it is running.

2) Edit the workspace by clicking the btn:[...] button of your selected workspace.

3) Navigate to the btn:[Graph Admin] tab.

4) Select the btn:[GSQL] section, then configure the following entries:

¦Input ¦ Description ¦ Example
¦GitHub URL For UDF ¦ Optional parameter used for GitHub Enterprise ¦ `https://api.github.com`
¦GitHub Repository For UDF ¦ The user and repository where the files are held ¦ `sample_user/repository`
¦Repository Branch For UDF ¦ The branch to access ¦ `main`
¦Repository Path For UDF ¦ Path to the directory in the repository that has ExprFunctions.hpp and ExprUtil.hpp ¦ `src/`
¦GitHub User Access Token For UDF ¦ The credential used to access the repository ¦ `anonymous`

5) Click btn:[Save] to apply the changes. 

[NOTE]
====
Update Graph Admin configurations may require restart of certain services, which may impact the running queries/loading jobs/schema changes. Apply changes with caution.

== Best Practices

* Version Control: Keep track of changes to your UDFs using a version control system.
* Testing: Thoroughly test UDFs in a development environment before deploying to production.
* Documentation: Document the purpose and usage of each UDF for future reference.

== Troubleshooting

* Syntax Errors: Double-check the syntax of your UDF code.
* Logic Errors: Ensure that the logic within the UDF is correct and handles all edge cases.
