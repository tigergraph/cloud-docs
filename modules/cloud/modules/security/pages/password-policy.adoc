= Password Policy
:experimental:

TigerGraph Cloud Classic user accounts have their own password requirements separate from the xref:tigergraph-server:security:password-policy.adoc[TigerGraph Server password policy].

No empty passwords are permitted. Each password must be at least 12 characters long and include at least one of the following:

* A special character from the set `!@#$%^&*`
* A lower case character `a-z`
* An upper case character `A-Z`
* A digit `0-9`

[NOTE]
This TigerGraph Cloud Classic password policy cannot be changed by users.

Organization Admins do not have access to change or reset user passwords in an Organization account.
If you forget your password, click the btn:[Forgot Password?] button during login, or contact support@tigergraph.com for assistance.
