= Service Limits

By default, TigerGraph Cloud Classic limits how many instances and how many vCPUs a single account can provision. These limits can be waived by request if you have a valid credit card on your account. To waive a service limit, please contact link:mailto:sales@tigergraph.com[sales@tigergraph.com].

The table below outlines the service limits for accounts with and without a valid credit card.

== Free tier cluster limits

Each registered account is allowed one cluster from the Free Tier. Free Tier instances do not include backups or support.

If no user activity is detected for more than one hour, TigerGraph may automatically stop a Free Tier instance. Users can manually restart the free tier instances from their cloud portal. After 7 days of inactivity, TigerGraph may terminate the inactive free tier instances.
