In the Peer VPC tab, fill in your link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant[Azure tenant ID], your VN name, your resource group ID, and your Subscription ID as well.
Click btn:[Next].

Click on the link in the instructions to add TigerGraph Cloud to your tenant.
Doing so opens a new tab, and if authorization is successful, it will redirect you back to the cloud portal.
You can now safely close this tab.

=== Assign Network Contributor role to TigerGraph Cloud VN Peerer
From the Azure portal, navigate to btn:[Virtual Networks] and choose the network you are peering with.
Then navigate to menu:Access Control[Add > Add role assignment].

If connection is successful, you'll see the connection listed under Azure with its status shown as "Connected".
