. Once you are satisfied with the samle data, click btn:[ Next ] to proceed.

== 3) Configure Map

.If you are loading data into a brand new graph, you will be prompted to let our engine generate a schema and mapping for you. Or you can start from scratch. For more details of schema design please refer to xref:savanna:graph-development:design-schema/index.adoc[Design Schema].
. Select `Generate the schema only` or `Generate the schema and data mapping`.

[CAUTION]
====
The schema generation feature is still a preview feature. The correctness and efficiency of the resulting graph schema and mapping could vary.
====

. In the `Source` column, you can choose the specific column from the data source that you want to map with the attribute.

+
    .. The btn:[Map all to target] button aligns existing attribute names with the corresponding data source headers, it won't introduce new attributes.
    .. The btn:[Map all from source] button not only aligns existing attribute names with the corresponding dat asource headers, but also introduces new attributes based on unmatched data source headers.
    .. The following list shows the mapping status of each attribute, you can manually adjust the mapping by checking the box next to the attribute name.

. Click btn:[Next] to proceed.

== 4) Confirm

.This step will let you confirm the changes made to the schema and the data mapping you created to load the data.
. Simply review the `Schema to be changed` and `Data to be loaded` lists.
