= Workspace Settings
:experimental:

The settings in workspace allow users to customize and fine-tune various aspects of their workspace configuration.
These settings include options like *auto-suspend* and *auto-resume*, which automate the suspension and resumption of the workspace based on activity levels.

[NOTE]
====
Only users with the roles of *Workspace Admin*, *Workgroup Admin*, or *Org Admin* can access the workspace settings menu.
====

To access the workspace settings, click on the btn:[ ... ] button next to the btn:[Connect] button on your workspace, then select the *Edit* option from the dropdown menu

A configuration panel will appear on the right side of your screen.

== General Settings

In the *General* tab, users can configure basic workspace options such as workspace size.

=== Workspace Size Suggestion

The *Size Suggestion* feature helps users select the appropriate workspace size by specifying the raw data size, compression ratio, and whether High Availability (HA) is enabled.

How to Use Size Suggestion:

* Raw Data Size: Enter the total size of your raw data in gigabytes (GB).
* Compression Ratio: Specify the expected compression ratio. This ratio helps estimate the actual memory required after data compression.
* Enable High Availability (HA): Indicate whether you want to enable High Availability for your workspace. Enabling HA ensures redundancy and improves fault tolerance.

Based on these inputs, the we will recommend an optimal workspace size that balances performance and cost efficiency.

[NOTE]
====
The size suggestion is for guidance only. Actual requirements may vary based on specific use cases and data characteristics.
====

== Advanced Settings

In the *Advanced Settings* tab, users can set the desired time intervals for auto-suspend and enable auto-resume to optimize resource usage and ensure a smooth user experience.

=== Auto-Suspend

Auto-suspend will automatically suspend your workspace after a specified period of inactivity.

[TIP]
====
This helps optimize resource utilization and cost when the workspace is not actively being used.
====

Choose an appropriate time interval for auto-suspend based on your typical usage patterns.

For example, if your workspace is usually inactive for long periods, you can set a shorter interval for auto-suspend to conserve resources.

[CAUTION]
Be mindful of any background processes or scheduled tasks that may require the workspace to remain active.
Adjust the auto-suspend interval accordingly to avoid interrupting critical processes.

==== Auto-Suspend Limitations

.The following operations are not treated as "active" and will not prevent the workspace from being auto-suspended:
* Consuming TigerGraph Cloud Controller APIs
* Configuring the workspace.
* Monitoring the workspace.
* Backuping/Restoring the workspace.

=== Auto-Resume
Auto-resume will automatically resume your workspace when activity is detected.

[TIP]
====
This ensures a seamless user experience without the need for manual intervention.
====

When the Auto Resume is enabled, the workspace will become “Idle” state instead of “Stopped”.
Auto-resume will kick-in when users access tools and rest APIs.

==== Auto-Resume Limitations

.The following endpoints will not trigger auto-resume:
* Consuming TigerGraph Cloud Controller APIs

== Add-ons

The *Add-ons* section allows users to enable and disable additional features and integrations based on their needs. This flexibility helps tailor the workspace to specific requirements and enhances functionality.

For the list of available add-ons and their capabilities, please refer to xref:cloud4:integrations:add-ons.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
Some add-ons may require additional configuration or incur extra costs. Review the documentation for each add-on to understand its capabilities and requirements.
====

== Alerts

The *Alerts* section allows users to set up notifications for various workspace events. Alerts help monitor the health and performance of your workspace and ensure timely responses to critical events.

== Graph Admin

The *Graph Admin* section provides access to advanced administrative settings for your graph database. These settings allow you to manage TigerGraph Server settings.

[NOTE]
====
Updating Graph Admin settings might result in the restart of certain TigerGraph services, which can cause temporary interruptions.
