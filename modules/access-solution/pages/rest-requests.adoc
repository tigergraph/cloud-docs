= Send REST Requests to a Solution

Besides GraphStudio, another way to interact with your TigerGraph database is through our REST API. Use RESTful endpoints to send requests to TigerGraph solutions and develop applications.

On TigerGraph Cloud, RESTPP authentication is enabled by default, and only the requests made with a valid authorization token in the request header will be accepted.

== Generate an authorization token

Here is a step-by-step guide to generating and using an authorization token for RESTPP:

=== 1. Navigate to User Management

From GraphStudio, go to menu:Admin Portal[User Management].

=== 2. Generate a secret

In the *My Profile* tab, find the graph you want to generate the secret for, enter an alias for your secret and click the btn:[*] symbol on the right side of the row.

Remember to copy and save the secret to a safe location. *This is the only time the secret will be fully visible in Admin Portal. You will not be able to see it again*.

=== 3. Generate a token

Use the `/requesttoken` endpoint to generate an authorization token for your solution. You can use either a GET or POST request. In this tutorial, we will be using a GET request.

==== 1. Find the domain name of your solution

If you did not enter a subdomain when setting up your solution, a random subdomain will be automatically generated for you. Go to *My Solutions*, and click the solution you are trying to access. You will find the solution's domain name in the expanded view. Use this domain name as the server address when making REST requests.

==== 2. Send the request to `/requesttoken`

The endpoint takes two parameters, `secret` and `lifetime`, and the latter is optional. Put the parameters in the query string and send the request using your favorite REST client. The below example uses curl to request the authentication token:

[source,console]
----
curl -X GET 'https://aa768d833bbf47fea6db80a7972a9477.i.tgcloud.io:9000/requesttoken?secret=5e3dmjc5l79n4v30jmsou02qji07f8tb'
----

The response will look like this, where the string in the response with the key `token` is your authorization token:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "code": "REST-0000",
  "expiration": 1617232169,
  "error": false,
  "message": "Generate new token successfully.",
  "token": "eq87e740arn73pp8chbf6j930pa7qorm"
}
----

=== 4. Send a request using your token

Now that you have an authorization token, you can proceed to make requests to your solution. To use the authorization token, include it in the request header as a bearer token.

Refer to our xref:3.2@tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc[RESTful API User Guide] to learn about all the endpoints available. In this tutorial, we will make a request to the xref:3.2@tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_list_vertices[List vertices] endpoint on a solution with the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6-QapCEz1M&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=TigerGraph[COVID-19 starter kit]. We'll list 5 patients and their ages.

[source,console]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer fc6p0i2ijjt031n0sja6m9ci70p232h7" \
"https://aa768d833bbf47fea6db80a7972a9477.i.tgcloud.io:9000/graph/MyGraph/vertices/Patient?limit=5&select=birth_year"
