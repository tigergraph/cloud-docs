= Expansion and Shrink
:experimental:

As your data grows or changes, you may need to adjust the capacity of your workspaces.
Users can easily expand or shrink workspaces to accommodate the evolving needs of graph databases.

== Expand or Shrink a Workspace

Scale up (expand) or down (shrink) as required, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

[NOTE]
====
Before initiating a downsize operation, a data topology size check is performed to ensure that the workspace size can accommodate the data.
If the size check fails, the downsize operation will not be allowed.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please be aware that resizing of workspaces is only allowed for Read-Write (RW) workspaces.
Resizing of Read-Only (RO) workspaces is strictly forbidden and not supported.
Recreate a RO workspace if you need to resize it.

[TIP]
====
Typically, resizing will take about 2 minutes depending on the data size and the workspace size.

=== Expansion and Shrink Limitations

An expansion or shrink is an offline operation.
If there are any other operations in progress on the workspace, they will be affected.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to schedule the expansion or shrink during a time when minimal or no operations are expected on the workspace to avoid any potential disruptions.
