= Pattern Search
:experimental:

Patterns search involves looking for specific patterns or sequences within a dataset or system. It can be used to identify recurring trends, anomalies, or correlations in data. By analyzing patterns, developers can gain insights and make informed decisions.

[CAUTION]
====
* Pattern search can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially for large datasets.
* Due to memory and processing constraints, pattern search is disabled for multi-node workspaces.

== How to use Pattern Search

.To get started with btn:[Explore Graph] follow the steps below:
. Navigate to the btn:[Explore Graph] tab in the left navigation.

. Then, choose which graph data you want to visualize patterns in.

. Once, you have the workspace and graph selected you can choose btn:[SHOW SCHEMA] to visualized the schema created when you loaded your data.

== Customize Your Pattern Search

.You can also create your own searches.In this example, we will visualize a node attribute of a small sample dataset.
. First we will select or btn:[nodes] data.
+

. Next, we will select btn:[Add filter]
+

. You should see a list of column entries from the data that was laoded in this workspace database. Select the one you want to search and visualize.
+

. Chose the operator and type in a number into the box on the right side of the equation.

. Now, select the image:patternserach-playbutton.png[width=50] or hit the btn:[ENTER] on your keyboard to run the visualizer and a result from your graph should appear.
+
[NOTE]
====
If nothing appears the data does not exist in your graph.
