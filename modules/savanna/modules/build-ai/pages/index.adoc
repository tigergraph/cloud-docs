= Build a Graph with AI
:experimental:

AI Build helps you go from CSV files to a ready-to-explore graph in minutes. It drafts a schema, loads your data, installs queries, and surfaces quick insights — all guided and automated.

== Prerequisites

Before you start:

* Your data is prepared as CSV/TSV files with headers.
** Total upload size limit: 1 GB
** Maximum total number of columns across all files: 120

== Entry Points

* From first-time organization sign-up: a workspace will be automatically and quickly provisioned
