= Build a Graph with AI
:experimental:

AI Build takes you from CSV files to a ready‑to‑explore graph in minutes. It drafts a schema, loads your data, installs queries, and surfaces quick insights—fully guided and automated.

** Total upload size limit: 1 GB
** Maximum total number of columns across all files: 120
