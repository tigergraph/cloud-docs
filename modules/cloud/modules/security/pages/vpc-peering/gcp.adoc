This is a guide for setting up a VPC peering connection between your
TigerGraph Cloud Classic VPC and another GCP VPC.

== Prerequisite

* At least one unterminated TigerGraph Cloud Classic cluster on GCP

== Procedure

[[initiate-vpc-peering]]

In the Peer VPC section, fill in the information of the VPC that you
hope to peer with:

* GCP Project ID
* VPC Name

Click btn:[Initiate VPC Peering].

[[create-vpc-peering-connection-from-peered-vpc-to-host-vpc]]
=== Create VPC peering connection from peered VPC to host VPC

Your TigerGraph VPC then creates a peering
configuration to the VPC you hope to peer with. At this time, the
peering connection will appear as *Inactive*. To complete the peering
connection, your still need to create a matching peering configuration
on your peered VPC to the TigerGraph VPC:

. In the Google Cloud Console, go to the btn:[VPC Network Peering] page.
https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/peering/list[Go to VPC
Network Peering]
. Click btn:[Create connection].
. Click btn:[Continue].
. Enter a *Name* for your peering connection.
. Under btn:[Your VPC network], select a network you want to peer.
. Select the TigerGraph network as the network to peer with.
* Select btn:[In another project]. You will need to specify the project ID
that includes the network you want to peer with and the name of the VPC
network:
** Project ID:`+tgcloud-prod+`
** VPC network name: Name of your TigerGraph Cloud Classic VPC. You can find it
in the menu:TigerGraph Cloud Classic portal[Network tab > VPC Peering] page.
Choose `+GCP+` as the platform, and in the VPC column is the VPC name.
. You can leave the other fields as they are (with only btn:[Export subnet
routes with public IP] selected) unless you need special configurations.
. Click btn:[Create].

After creating the matching peering configuration, the status of your VPC connection should change to btn:[Active] meaning the two VPCs are peered successfully.
