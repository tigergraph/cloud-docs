= Send REST Requests to a Cluster
:experimental:
:page-aliases: solutions/access-solution/rest-requests.adoc


Besides GraphStudio, another way to interact with your TigerGraph database is through the REST API, also known as RESTPP.

On TigerGraph Cloud Classic, RESTPP authentication is enabled by default, and only the requests made with a valid authorization token in the request header are accepted.

== Generate an authorization token

This process is handled through the Admin Portal, which can be accessed through the Tools menu in a cluster.

Here is a step-by-step guide to generating and using an authorization token for RESTPP:

=== 1. Navigate to User Management

In the Admin Portal, click btn:[User Management] in the left side panel.

=== 2. Generate a secret

In the *My Profile* tab, find the graph you want to generate the secret for, enter an alias for your secret and click the btn:[*] symbol on the right side of the row.

Remember to copy and save the secret to a safe location. *This is the only time the secret will be fully visible in Admin Portal. You will not be able to see it again*.

=== 3. Generate a token

Use the `POST /requesttoken` endpoint to generate an authorization token for your cluster.

==== 1. Find the domain name of your cluster

If you did not enter a subdomain when setting up your cluster, a random subdomain is automatically generated for you.
Go to *My Clusters*, and click the cluster you are trying to access.
You will find the cluster's domain name in the expanded view.
Use this domain name as the server address when making REST requests.

==== 2. Send the request to `POST /requesttoken`

The endpoint takes two parameters, `secret` and `lifetime`, and the latter is optional.
Put the parameters in the query string and send the request using your favorite REST client.
The below example uses curl to request the authentication token:

[source.wrap,console]

$ curl -X POST https://example.i.tgcloud.io:443/restpp/requesttoken -d '{"secret": "n35lsqofc1if62fld2rmnb9hocqbh8ia", "lifetime": "100000"}'

[NOTE]
For TigerGraph Cloud Classic clusters created before June 20, 2022, replace "443/restpp" with "9000". See the xref:release-notes:index.adoc[] for details.

This is a sample response, where the string in the response with the key `token` is your authorization token:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "code": "REST-0000",
  "expiration": 1616042814,
  "error": false,
  "message": "Generate new token successfully.\nWarning: Tigergraph Support cannot restore access to secrets/tokens for security reasons. Please save your secret/token and keep it safe and accessible.",
  "token": "tohvf6khjqju8jf0r0l1cohhlm8gi5fq"
}
----

=== 4. Send a request using your token or secret

Now that you have an authorization token, you can proceed to make requests to your cluster.

==== Token Request
To use the authorization token, include it in the request header as a bearer token.

The following example makes a request to the xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_list_vertices[List vertices] endpoint on a cluster with the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6-QapCEz1M&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=TigerGraph[COVID-19 starter kit].

The request lists 5 patients and their ages.

==== Secret Request

To use the authorization secret, include it in the request header as a GSQL-Secret.

curl -H "Authorization: GSQL-Secret fc6p0i2ijjt031n0sja6m9ci70p232h7" \
