== Sizing and Scaling


=== *Q: How do I determine the instance needed for my workload?*
A: To determine the appropriate instance for your workload, follow these guidelines:

* **Check Available Instance Types:** Refer to xref:index.adoc[] to see the instance types offered by each cloud provider in each region. Larger graphs require more RAM, while higher performance necessitates both more CPUs and more RAM.
* **Use the Pricing Table:** Our xref:savanna:overview:pricing.adoc[pricing table] provides initial recommendations for which instance to start with based on the amount of data you plan to load into the graph. This input data is referred to as your "raw data." TigerGraph reorganizes your data into a graph, encoding and compressing it. Typically, the stored graph will be about 70% of the size of your raw data, although this is a conservative estimate and it’s often smaller.
* **Consider RAM Requirements:** In addition to storage, you need sufficient RAM for graph querying and computation. Different applications of TigerGraph can require varying amounts of RAM. We recommend that your total RAM be about 1.5 times the maximum amount of raw data you expect to load.
* **Scale as Needed:** If you find you need more space or compute power, you can easily scale up your instance.
* **Use Tools for Assistance:**
** xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/settings.adoc#_workspace_size_suggestion[Workspace Size Suggestion]: This tool helps you determine the appropriate instance size for your workload.
** xref:savanna:overview:cost-estimation.adoc[Cost Estimation]: This tool helps you estimate the cost of your TigerGraph Savanna environment.

For additional assistance, you can submit a support ticket through the TigerGraph Savanna Portal or https://tigergraph.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/[from Zendesk].

=== *Q: How do I expand the disk size?*

There is no need to expand the disk size on TigerGraph Savanna, since the graph data is stored separately from the instance. You can scale up your instance to a larger size if you need more RAM or CPU power.


=== *Q: Can I migrate my database to a larger (or smaller) workpace?*

A: Yes, you can just expand or shrink your existing workspace. To do this, simply edit your workspace settings as described in the xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/settings.adoc[] documentation. Alternatively, you can set up an expand/shrink operation on a predefined schedule by following the instructions in the xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/schedule.adoc[] documentation.

=== *Q: Can I deploy a distributed TigerGraph database across a cluster of instances?*

A: Yes, you can provision a distributed database in TigerGraph Savanna. Please refer to the xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/workspace-size.adoc[] documentation for more information.

== Hardware


=== *Q: What type of disks are attached to the provisioned TigerGraph Instances?*

A: The provisioned TigerGraph instances have the following disk configurations:

== Provisioning, Backup and Restore


=== *Q: What is a workgroup, workspace, database?*

A: In TigerGraph Savanna, the concepts of workgroup, workspace, and database are used to organize and manage projects and data within the platform. Here's a breakdown of each term:

* Workgroup: A workgroup represents a project or a logical group within TigerGraph Savanna. It serves as a container that holds multiple workspaces and databases related to a specific use case, team, or application. Workgroups provide a way to organize and manage resources, access controls, and configurations for a particular project or initiative.
* Workspace: A workspace is a compute unit within a TigerGraph database. It is where the graph processing and analytics take place. TigerGraph Savanna supports two types of workspaces: read-write workspaces and read-only workspaces.
** Read-write workspaces: These workspaces allow read and write operations on the graph data. They are typically used for data ingestion, data updates, and running queries that modify the graph structure or properties.
** Read-only workspaces: These workspaces are optimized for read-intensive operations. They are used for executing queries and analytics on the graph data without modifying it. Read-only workspaces provide improved performance and scalability for read operations.
* Database: The database in TigerGraph Savanna refers to the actual data stored within the platform. It is separate from the workspaces and can be associated with one or more workspaces within a workgroup. It holds the persistent data that is loaded into TigerGraph and is accessible for graph analytics and visualization. We only support a maximum of one ready-write workspace to connect to a database.

By utilizing workgroups, workspaces, and databases, TigerGraph Savanna provides a flexible and scalable environment for managing projects, allocating compute resources, and working with graph data effectively. The separation of compute and storage in workspaces allows for optimized performance and resource allocation, while the databases ensure the persistence and accessibility of the graph data.



=== *Q: Is there a warm-up period for TigerGraph workspaces?*

A: When you provision or restart a workspace, there will be a warm-up period for the workspace.
The larger the data size and the greater the size of workspace, the longer the warm-up period will be.


=== *Q: What is the difference between stopping, pausing, and terminating a workspace?*

A: 

Stopping a Workspace:

* **Action**: Shuts down the workspace without listening to incoming requests.
* **State**: The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state.
* **Billing**: Billing for the machine instance stops, but you will still incur charges for disk storage and backups.
* **Backups**: Scheduled backups stop, but existing backup copies are kept in storage.
* **Recovery**: You can start the workspace again, and after a warmup period, it will return to its previous state.

Pausing a Workspace:

* **Action**: Suspends the workspace but listening to incoming requests.
* **State**: The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state.
* **Billing**: Billing for the machine instance stops, but you will still incur charges for disk storage and backups.
* **Backups**: Scheduled backups stop, but existing backup copies are kept in storage.
* **Recovery**: The workspace will resume automatically if incoming requests are detected or can be manually started. After a warmup period, it will return to its previous state.

Terminating a Workspace:

* **Action**: Deprovisions the workspace and the attached disk space.
* **State**: The workspace and all its data are deleted according to the cloud platform's policies.
* **Billing**: All associated billing stops, including for the virtual machine instance, disk storage, and backups.
* **Backups**: We will keep the latest backup in storage for 15 days and then delete.
* **Recovery**: The workspace cannot be recovered once terminated.

In summary:

* **Stopping**: Shuts down the workspace but keeps data and backups; can be restarted.
* **Pausing**: Suspends the workspace while still listening for requests.
* **Terminating**: Completely deletes the workspace and its data; cannot be recovered.

=== *Q: Do you offer backup in TigerGraph Savanna?*

A: Yes. Please see our guide for using xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workgroups/backup-and-restore.adoc[] in the TigeGraph Cloud 4 Portal.


=== *Q: What backup options are available?*

A: TigerGraph Savanna offers full backups on a scheduled or on-demand basis.
By default, backup is turned on when instances are running and will be done daily.
There are four backup schedules you can choose from: daily, weekly, monthly, and ad hoc.
Please refer to the xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workgroups/backup-and-restore.adoc[] documentation for more information. You can also check the quota policy for the backup in the xref:savanna:resources:quota_policy.adoc[Quota Policy] documentation.

=== *Q: Can I restore from a backup from another workspace in my account?*

A: Cross workspace restore is not supported yet. Contact TigerGraph Support to restore from another workspace backup.


=== *Q: What happens to my automated backups if I terminate my workspace?*

A: We will keep the latest backup for 15 days and then delete.
Within that 15 days, you may use your backup to restore into another similar cluster if it is a single server cluster.
To restore a cluster within 15 days, please submit a support ticket through the cloud portal.


=== *Q: How soon can I restore from a backup that I just made?*

A: After you perform a backup, you should wait at least 15 minutes.


=== *Q: How can I delete my TigerGraph Savanna account?*

A: Please submit a support ticket through the cloud portal.

== High Availability and Replication


=== *Q: What kind of replicas does TigerGraph Savanna support?*

A:  TigerGraph Distributed Cloud offers active-active replication for increased availability and automatic failover.

A TigerGraph system with High Availability (HA) is a cluster of server machines which uses replication to provide continuous service when one or more servers are not available or when some service components fail.
TigerGraph HA service provides loading balancing when all components are operational, as well as automatic failover in the event of a service disruption.

[#q-what-is-the-replication-factor]
=== *Q: What is the replication factor?*

A: Replication factor means how many copies of data are stored, each on a separate machine.
You can enable HA, which adds a replication factor of 2 or 3 for your workspace. For workspaces TG-8 and below, the replication factor is set to 3 if HA is enabled. For TG-16 and above, the replication factor is set to 2 if HA is enabled.

[#q-what-is-the-partition-factor]
=== *Q: What is the partition factor?*

A: Partition factor means the number of parts or components your graph data is split into, which also equals the number of instances that collectively store one copy of the full graph.
For example, if you select a partition factor of 3, each instance will hold approximately 1/3 of your data.
Please read the xref:tigergraph-server:cluster-and-ha-management:ha-cluster.adoc[] documentation for additional details about partitions and replications. For the partition factor for each workspace size, please refer to the xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/workspace-size.adoc[] documentation.

[#q-what-is-the-difference-between-replication-and-partition]


=== *Q: How long do I need to wait for the cluster to be ready after provisioning process starts?*

A: It currently takes about 4 minutes to provision a workspace. It might take longer for Read-Only workspaces or Read-Write workspaces with a solution kit selected.

== Network, Security and User Management

=== *Q: Does TigerGraph Savanna support encrypting my data in transit and at rest?*

A: Yes, TigerGraph Savanna encrypts all data in transit and at rest.


=== *Q: Am I sharing data storage with other customers? Is TigerGraph a multi-tenant cluster?*

A: You are not sharing storage with other customers. For compute resources:

* TG-2 and below: You share the virtual machine with other customers, but the TigerGraph database runs as containers, which are completely isolated from each other. Your data storage remains secure and isolated.
* TG-4 and above: Each TigerGraph workspace is provisioned as one or more dedicated virtual machine instances of the TigerGraph engine, used exclusively for your account. These instances come with their own dedicated disk space, ensuring that no two accounts share the same TigerGraph database.

Additionally, the network is completely isolated per workgroup, providing an extra layer of security and ensuring that your network traffic is segregated from that of other customers.

This approach guarantees that your data and network remain private and secure, regardless of the compute resource tier you are using.

=== *Q: How do I access my TigerGraph Savanna account (e.g., username and password)?*

A: When you register your account, you can select either a username and password or Google SSO for authentication. You can then log in anytime at link:http://portal.tgcloud.io/[portal.tgcloud.io]. We also support Okta and AAD integration. If you are a paid tier customer, please submit a support ticket to request advanced service to integrate into an SSO system TigerGraph supports.

=== *Q: How do I access my TigerGraph database and POST to TigerGraph?*

A: You can access the database through the TigerGraph Savanna portal, TigerGraph GraphStudio™ visual interface and through RESTful endpoints. Use RESTful endpoints to POST to TigerGraph clusters and develop applications. Please refer to the xref:tigergraph-server:API:index.adoc[RESTful API User Guide] for more information. To find the RESTful endpoints for queries created in GraphStudio™, please read our documentation on xref:gui:graphstudio:write-queries.adoc[showing query endpoints]. There is also a recorded webinar which demos the process in detail: link:https://info.tigergraph.com/graph-gurus-24[Graph Gurus Episode 24]

*Here is the step-by-step instructions:*

TigerGraph Savanna enables xref:tigergraph-server:API:authentication.adoc[REST{pp} Authentication] to securely connect TigerGraph Savanna workspaces with your application through an endpoint on port 443 at `443/restpp/<endpoint>`.


*Step 1:* (First time only) Navigate to the TigerGraph cluster's Admin Portal, and generate a secret from User Management.

For example, the URL for the cluster is:

[source,text]
----
https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:443/admin/#/user-management
----

and the generated secret is `abcd1234` from the Admin Portal.

*Step 2:* (Need to renew every lifetime) Use the secret generated in step 1 to get a RESTPP token (for example, xyz789) using `curl`. Access RESTPP endpoints on port 443 using the syntax `443/restpp/<endpoint>`.

Here is an example where you obtain a token with a lifetime of 1,000,000 seconds (11 days):

[source,text]
----
curl -X POST 'https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:443/restpp/requesttoken -d '{"secret"="abcd1234", "lifetime"="1000000"}'
----

[source,text]
----
{
  "code":"REST-0000",
  "expiration":1570727825,
  "error":false,
  "message":"Generate new token successfully.",
  "token":"xyz789"
}
----

*Step 3:*  Now in your application, use the token in the REST call as follows:

[source,text]
----
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer xyz789" 'https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:443/restpp/graph/MyGraph/vertices/Account?limit=3'
----


=== *Q: Does TigerGraph Savanna offer Role Based Access Control?*

A: TigerGraph's role-based access control with MultiGraph and User Management is available if you use TigerGraph V3.0.5+.


=== *Q: What happens to my data if I terminate an instance or if my account is closed?*

A: When you terminate an instance in TigerGraph Distributed Cloud, the virtual machine instance and its associated storage volume are deleted according to the policies of the underlying cloud infrastructure vendor.


=== *Q: How does TigerGraph Savanna secure my data?*

A: TigerGraph Savanna encrypts data at rest and in transit, and SSL is enabled for secure access.


=== *Q: Can I integrate TigerGraph Savanna into my single sign on system?*

A: The ability to use cloud portal to integrate TigerGraph Savanna into an SSO system will be provided at a future date.

=== *Q: How can I improve the speed of my system?*

For a given hardware configuration, performance can be improved by optimizing graph schema, loading jobs, and queries.
In TigerGraph Distributed Cloud, you can also choose to provision a cluster with replication factor 2 to increase throughput.
