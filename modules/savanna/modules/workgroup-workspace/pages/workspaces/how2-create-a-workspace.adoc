. For supported workspace sizes, please go to the xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/workspace-size.adoc[] page.

. For advanced settings please refer to xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/settings.adoc[] page.

. Specify database name or attach to an existing database.

.. This allows you to create Read-Write (RW) workspace or Read-Only (RO) workspace.
For more details, please refer to xref:savanna:workgroup-workspace:workspaces/readwrite-readonly.adoc[].

. Specify Solutions for your workspace, for more details please visit xref:savanna:integrations:solutions.adoc[] page.

. Click on the btn:[ Create ] button to create the workspace.
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently, only one Read-Write workspace can be created for any given database.
This means that multiple simultaneous Read-Write workspaces cannot be created, potentially limiting certain collaborative or concurrent development scenarios.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Users cannot re-create the Read-Write workspace once it has been terminated.
====

. The workspace will then start to build.
This progress can be monitored on the btn:[General Tab].
+

. Once built you can view details about your workspace on the workspace tab.
And you can view information about your database on the database tab.
