= Access a Solution through GSQL Web Shell

[NOTE]

The GSQL Web Shell is temporarily disabled for new solutions due to recent networking improvements on the TigerGraph Cloud backend. Please use the xref:tigergraph-server:gsql-shell:using-a-remote-gsql-client.adoc[Remote GSQL client] to access GSQL on new TigerGraph Cloud solutions until access is restored. Solutions created before June 20, 2022 are unaffected and still have access to the Web Shell.

With a paid tier solution and a valid payment method, you can also access the solution through the GSQL Web Shell. The web shell allows you to run GSQL commands on your TigerGraph Cloud solution.

== Open GSQL Web Shell

=== 1. Navigate to My Solutions

After https://tgcloud.io/[logging into TigerGraph Cloud], go to *My Solutions*.
